# Project Summary

This project involves creating a web-based music key converter that allows users to input musical notes and chords, and then convert them into Roman numerals based on a selected key. The application includes features for applying special rules, simplifying complex chords, and adding musical tensions (like b9, 9, #9, etc.) that are displayed with specific colors in the output. Users can select whether to apply these special rules, offering flexibility in how chords are interpreted and displayed.

## Designer Note

The primary goal of this project was to create an intuitive and flexible tool for musicians and composers, allowing them to explore and visualize harmonic relationships in different keys. The inclusion of customizable tensions and the option to apply or ignore special rules were critical to providing users with control over their outputs, making the tool versatile for various musical styles and needs. The visual differentiation of tensions through color coding was intended to enhance clarity and usability, making it easier for users to interpret results at a glance. This tool is designed to be both educational and practical, helping users better understand musical theory while also aiding in the composition and arrangement process.
